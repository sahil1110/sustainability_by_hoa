# sustainability_by_hoa
Suburban areas play an integral role in the development of sustainable cities; however, developers often do not consider sustainability in the construction of subdivisions and the subsequent adoption of homeowner's association (HOA) covenants. While there are multiple actions homeowners can take to contribute to personal sustainability on the plot-by-plot level, these actions are not always adopted or supported by greater neighborhood norms.

The current literature provides assessments of individual sustainability indicators at the homeowner and neighborhood level as well as multi-indicator sustainability assessments of cities and larger metropolitan areas but lacks such multi-indicator analyses at the homeowner and neighborhood level. This study assesses the relationship among multiple sustainability indicators of homeowner behavior including recycling habits, lawn care, tree planting, and home gardening, and compares these behaviors between neighborhoods with HOAs and those without. Data metrics were collected from twelve neighborhoods in Greenville, South Carolina through on-site observation, analysis of Google Earth images, and qualitative assessment of HOA covenants.

The data for this report consists of 1,616 observations of homes in Greenville, SC and the seven variables recorded for each. 
Basic descriptions of the variables and other important information can be found below.

Neighborhood: This reports which of the 12 neighborhoods in Greenville, SC each observed home is located. There are no missing values for this variable. 
Lot Number: This reports the lot number of the homes. There are no missing values for this variable. 
HOA: This reports whether or not the homes are part of a homeowners' association (1 = yes; 2 = no). There are no missing values for this variable.
Recycle: This reports the recycling status of the homes (1 = both recycling bin and trash bin present at the home; 2 = only a trash bin was present). There are 274 missing values for this variable. These missing values correspond to neighborhoods with no curb side pick up (i.e., Brownstone, Edgewood, Glastonbury, and Fox Springs).
Lawn Care: This represents a likert variable on a scale of 1 to 4 (1 = excellent; 2 = good; 3= poor; 4 = none). This measure
maps onto how artificially managed the lawn is where 1 means the lawns were highly artificially managed with presumed regular chemical application and 4 means the lawns were naturally managed (i.e., not managed at all). There are no missing values for this variable.
Trees: This represents the number of trees in the front yard. There are 14 missing values for this variable. 
Garden: This represents whether a garden was present in the front or back of the homes (1 = yes; 2 = no). There are no missing values for this variable.
